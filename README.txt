Concisely, we are building a web app were communities can host time banks, or organizations where individuals can exchange hours of specialized labor for credits, which they can then directly redeem in hours of work/service from other members of their community.

Our solution will leverage HTML/CSS/JS and Bootstrap for the frontend, and Python with Django and MySQL for the backend
